1. Setup ruby using brew:

        brew install ruby

2. Add ruby to PATH for your current terminal. This isn't done permanently because it can interfere with the native ruby installation.

        export PATH="/usr/local/opt/ruby/bin:$PATH"

3. Create Gemfile. The contents of the file should be:

        source "https://rubygems.org"

        gem "github-pages", group: :jekyll_plugins

4. Run installation:

        bundle install

5. Build site:

        bundle exec jekyll build

6. Serve site:

        bundle exec jekyll serve
