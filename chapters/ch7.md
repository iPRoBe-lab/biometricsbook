title: "Chapter 7: Additional Biometric Traits  "
description: Introduction to Biometrics
---


Every biometric system relies on one or more biometric modalities. The choice of modality is a key driver of how the system is architected, how it is presented to the user, and how match versus non-match decisions are made. Understanding particular modalities and how best to use the modalities is critical to overall system effectiveness.
